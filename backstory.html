            <p>Hey Choom/Choomba! Its a good thing you've made it. Look.. the tech ovrlords arent happy we remade <i>"Flappy Bird" </i>but better.</br></br>I need your help getting out of this crazy city with the data still in tact! You're going to be my pilot and you'll need to keep us from hitting the buildings as we pass through the light rings I've opened up. We will need to clear all 20 to get enough power to jump into space. Hope you don't have motion sickness! </br> </br>How to Play: Click 'SPACEBAR' or TAP the screen to jump, don't crash my ship!
