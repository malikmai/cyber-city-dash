# Cyber City Dash

A "Flappy Bird" styled game.

Cyber City Dash is a simple yet challenging browser-based game where you pilot a ship through a dynamic cityscape, avoiding buildings by navigating through gaps. The goal is to clear 20 light rings to escape the city and venture deep into space.

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Buildings that move across the screen with gaps at random heights that you must navigate through.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points by successfully navigating through gaps. The game tracks your score, and the game ends successfully when you reach a score of 20.

2. **Jump**: Press 'Space' or tap the screen to make the ship jump and avoid obstacles.
3. **Avoid Obstacles**: Navigate through the gaps in the buildings that scroll from right to left.
